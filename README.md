# Brique
**Brique** is an abstract connection game for two players, 
based on the original rules designed by *Luis Bola√±os Mures*.

This is our Java implementation of the game, 
developed as an educational project following the principles of **Test-Driven Development**, 
**Continuous Integration**, and **good software design practices**.

## üïπÔ∏è Main Rules

- The game is played on a 15x15 square grid.
- The top and bottom edges of the board are **black**; the left and right edges are **white**.
- **Black plays first** and turns alternate between players.
- After each move, **escorts** are automatically filled (and enemy stones removed, if present).
- The first player to connect their two opposite sides with an orthogonally connected chain of stones wins the game.
